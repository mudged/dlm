### REQ-001 — Go service and Next.js + Tailwind web UI

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | REQ-001 |
| **Title** | Go service and Next.js + Tailwind web UI |
| **Priority** | Must |
| **Actor(s)** | End user; operator / maintainer |

**User story**

As a user, I want a web application backed by a **Golang** service with a **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS** front end, so that I have a maintainable full-stack product with a modern UI toolchain.

**Scope**

- In scope: HTTP-capable Go backend (API and/or static coordination as later architecture defines); Next.js app with Tailwind for styling; clear separation between backend and UI code in the repository layout (exact structure deferred to architecture).
- Out of scope: Choice of specific Go web framework, database, auth provider, and hosting topology beyond the Pi target in REQ-003.

**Business rules**

1. The product MUST include deployable Go server code and a Next.js application using Tailwind.
2. The UI MUST consume or coordinate with the backend in a way defined in `docs/architecture.md` (deferred until architect pass).

**Responsive / UX notes** *(when UI is involved)*

- Mobile: Not applicable at requirements-only level for this REQ; see REQ-002.
- Tablet: Not applicable at requirements-only level for this REQ; see REQ-002.
- Desktop: Not applicable at requirements-only level for this REQ; see REQ-002.

**Dependencies**

- None

**Open questions**

- None

### REQ-002 — Responsive, reactive UI across device classes

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | REQ-002 |
| **Title** | Responsive, reactive UI across device classes |
| **Priority** | Must |
| **Actor(s)** | End user |

**User story**

As a user, I want the interface to **respond to my actions** and **adapt to mobile, tablet, and desktop** viewports, so that the product is usable on phones, tablets, and PCs.

**Scope**

- In scope: Responsive layout and typography; interactive client behavior (loading, navigation, forms, or other patterns as designed); touch-friendly patterns on small screens where controls exist.
- Out of scope: Native mobile apps; offline-first PWA requirements unless added in a later requirement.

**Business rules**

1. Primary user-facing flows MUST remain **usable** at typical mobile, tablet, and desktop widths without relying on desktop-only interaction patterns where alternatives exist.
2. The UI MUST be **reactive** (client-side interactivity appropriate for Next.js), not a static HTML-only brochure unless a later requirement explicitly narrows scope.

**Responsive / UX notes** *(when UI is involved)*

- Mobile: Layout stacks appropriately; readable text; interactive controls reachable; minimize horizontal scrolling for primary content.
- Tablet: Balanced use of space; orientation changes handled gracefully where applicable.
- Desktop: Efficient use of width; keyboard and pointer interactions supported.

**Dependencies**

- REQ-001

**Open questions**

- Minimum supported browsers and OS versions (if any).

### REQ-003 — Target deployment on Raspberry Pi 4 Model B

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | REQ-003 |
| **Title** | Target deployment on Raspberry Pi 4 Model B |
| **Priority** | Must |
| **Actor(s)** | Operator / maintainer |

**User story**

As an operator, I want the system **designed and documented for deployment** on a **Raspberry Pi 4 Model B**, so that I can run the stack on that hardware reliably within its constraints.

**Scope**

- In scope: Architecture and deployment documentation addressing Pi 4 Model B (including **ARM64** / resource awareness), process model for Go and Next.js artifacts on the device, and operational assumptions needed to install and run the stack.
- Out of scope: Providing production Pi images or CI hardware; exact OS distribution unless captured in architecture.

**Business rules**

1. `docs/architecture.md` MUST describe how the Go service and Next.js build fit the Pi 4 B deployment context after the architect pass.
2. Documentation MUST acknowledge **ARM64** and typical Pi **CPU/RAM** limits when stating runtime and build choices.

**Responsive / UX notes** *(when UI is involved)*

- Mobile: N/A
- Tablet: N/A
- Desktop: N/A

**Dependencies**

- REQ-001

**Open questions**

- Preferred OS on the Pi (e.g. Raspberry Pi OS 64-bit) and whether a reverse proxy is mandatory.
- REQ-004 constrains packaging to a **single executable**; `docs/architecture.md` MUST be updated to reconcile Pi deployment (this REQ) with that constraint.

### REQ-004 — Single executable packaging (no Docker at this stage)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | REQ-004 |
| **Title** | Single executable packaging (no Docker at this stage) |
| **Priority** | Must |
| **Actor(s)** | Operator / maintainer |

**User story**

As an operator, I want the product **packaged as a single executable file** per target platform, so that deployment on the Pi (and elsewhere) means copying and running **one binary** without orchestrating multiple product processes or container runtimes from the distribution.

**Scope**

- In scope: Defining that the **primary deliverable** for a given OS/CPU (e.g. **linux/arm64** for Pi) is **one executable file** that fulfills the product’s runtime obligations (HTTP API and serving the UI per REQ-001), subject to how `docs/architecture.md` realizes that shape **within a single process/binary**.
- In scope: Explicitly deferring **Docker / OCI images**, **Dockerfile**-mandated workflows, and **docker-compose** (or equivalent) as **required** distribution or runtime packaging **at this stage**.
- Out of scope: Operators voluntarily using containers locally; third-party tools not shipped as part of the product.
- Out of scope: **Microsoft Windows** and **macOS** executable variants unless added by a later requirement (initial focus remains Pi / **linux/arm64** unless extended).

**Business rules**

1. For each supported **release target** documented in `docs/architecture.md`, the product MUST ship (or document a reproducible build of) **exactly one runnable executable file** as the application binary—**not** a bundle that **requires** a separate Node.js runtime binary, **nor** a **second** application-specific daemon shipped alongside the main program for routine operation.
2. Supporting assets (if any) MUST either be **embedded in that executable** or **generated at runtime** by it; **shell scripts** or loose file trees that must accompany the binary for **normal** startup are **not** acceptable as the primary packaging story **except** OS-level service wrappers (e.g. **systemd** unit files) that only invoke the single binary.
3. **Docker** images, **container** as the **canonical** install path, and **compose** files as **mandatory** deployment are **out of scope** at this stage; documentation MUST NOT present containers as the **only** or **required** way to run the product.
4. `docs/architecture.md` MUST be updated after this requirement is accepted so that the **single-process / single-binary** model, Pi constraints (REQ-003), and Next.js + Tailwind behavior (REQ-001/002) are **consistent**.

**Responsive / UX notes** *(when UI is involved)*

- Mobile: N/A at requirements level (REQ-002 still governs rendered UI).
- Tablet: N/A
- Desktop: N/A

**Dependencies**

- REQ-001, REQ-003

**Open questions**

- Whether **full Next.js SSR** must be preserved inside one binary or whether a **static export + client hydration** pattern controlled by architecture is acceptable if UX acceptance (REQ-002) is still met.
